1. Use Makefile to compile my program "lab5.cpp", the command is g++ -O3 -o Lab5 lab5.cpp
2. Run the executable file: ./Lab5 <input> <output>

However, I failed to modify case1's column usage and would cause spill-over area in net 3 with Greedy Algorithm. Sorry for being exhausted for the debugging and giving out in this Lab. 

By the way, I have two thoughts to overcome the issue:
1.It maybe can be done by the maze-routing to deal with the rest open net but not yet trying this way.
2. Try to rotate left-right or top-bottom to make the general routing case
